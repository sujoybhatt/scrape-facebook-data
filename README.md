# scrape-facebook-data
 These Python scripts use selenium and the ChromeDriver to scrape pages on Facebook. They rely on XPath expressions to fetch content and hence they might stop working when Facebook changes their page design.
 Just a disclaimer that these scripts are an excercise in testing the capabilities of ChromeDriver. I do not endorse/recommend their use for extracting data from Facebook.
