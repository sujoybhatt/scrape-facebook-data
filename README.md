# scrape-facebook-data
These Python scripts use selenium and ChromeDriver to scrape data from Pages on Facebook. They rely on XPath expressions to fetch content and hence they might stop working when Facebook changes their page design.
 Just a disclaimer that these scripts are an exercise in testing the capabilities of ChromeDriver. I do not endorse/recommend their use for extracting data from Facebook Pages especially those for which you are not the admin.
